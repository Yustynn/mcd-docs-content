# Maker Protocol Deployments

## Find all Maker Protocol contract addresses and ABIs at [chainlog.makerdao.com](https://chainlog.makerdao.com/)

The [Chainlog](https://chainlog.makerdao.com/) provides valuable information for developers interacting with Maker Protocol deployments. This includes deployments on the following networks:&#x20;

* **Ethereum Mainnet (**[**latest release**](https://chainlog.makerdao.com/api/mainnet/active.json)**)**
* **Ethereum Goerli Testnet (**[**latest release**](https://chainlog.makerdao.com/api/goerli/active.json)**)**

Each release includes the following information:&#x20;

* Contract addresses with link to Etherscan
* ABIs

### Onchain Contract Address Directory

The Chainlog is also available as an onchain smart contract directory ([dss-chain-log](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-chain-log#dss-chain-log)) that allows developers to programatically fetch Maker Protocol contract addresses directly in a smart contract. This is useful for integrators that want to future-proof implementations in case a Maker module is updated. You can [read more about how to utilize the dss-chain-log here.](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-chain-log#dss-chain-log)
